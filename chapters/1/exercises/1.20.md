# Exercise 1.20

> The process that a procedure generates is of course dependant on the rules used by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative `gcd` procedure given above. 
> Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order evaulation. Using the substitution method (for normal order), illustrate the process generated in 
> evaluating `(gcd 206 40)` and indicate the `remainder` operations that are actually performed. 
> How many `remainder` operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)`? In the applicative-order evaluation?

```scheme
(define (gcd a b)
    (if (= b 0)
        a
        (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

## Recap

As a refresher, normal-order evaluation is when operators and operands are fully expanded and then reduced, while
applicative-order evaluation evaluates operators first before expanding.

## Normal-order evaluation

If we expand the result of `(gcd 206 40)` using normal-order evaluation we would get the following:

```scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(if (= 40 0) ...)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(if (= (remainder 206 40) 0) ...)
(if (= 6 0) ...)
(gcd (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
(if (= (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) 0) ...)
(if (= 4 0) ...)
(gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))
(if (= (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))) 0) ...)
(if (= 2 0) ...)
(gcd (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))) (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))
(if (= (remainder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)) (remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))) 0) ...)
(if (= 0 0) ...)
(remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
2
```

we can observe that the `remainder` procedure is evaluated 18 times when using normal-order evaluation.

## Applicative-order evaluation

With applicative-order evaluation we will expand all parameters first before evaluating:

```scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))
(gcd 2 0)
```

and as we see here, the applicative-order evaluation only requires 4 procedure calls to `remainder`.
